## Frontend Monolith or modular.
### Monolith
* Native mobile & rich client apps: Cordova
* SPAs(Single Page Apps)
* Single team
* migration

### Modularized frontend
Each microservice has an frontend, then we need to have an integration system.

## Integration options
* links
* redirects: combine frontend integration with data transfer.
* [transclusions](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/transclusion/): combining the content of a website with the content of another website

## Resource-oriented Client Architecture (ROCA) principles
* Adherence to REST principles
* Accessible information via HTML, JSON or XML.
* Logic on server
* Authentication in HTTP request
* Cookies for authentication, tracking or protection against cross-site request forgery.
* No server-side sessions
* Browser controls.
* No layout in HTML: separate content and layout with CSS>
* JavaScript only for progressive enhancement
* No redundant logic.

## Benefits
* Loose coupling
* Logic and UI in one microservice
* free choice of frontend technologies.
